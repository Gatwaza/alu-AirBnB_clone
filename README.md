AirBnB Clone

This project is a clone of the popular vacation rental platform, AirBnB. It allows users to create, retrieve, and manage objects related to the platform such as Users, States, Cities, and Places.

Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a program that allows the user to interact with the objects of the project. It allows the user to:

Create new objects (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object
To start the command interpreter, run the command:


./console.py
You will be presented with a prompt "(hbnb)".

To see a list of available commands, enter:


(hbnb) help
Examples
Create a new User:


(hbnb) create User
Retrieve a Place by id:


(hbnb) show Place 1234-5678-
Update the name of a User:

(hbnb) update User +25078.... name "name"
